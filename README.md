# FaceMask_Detection
This project uses a Deep Neural Network to differentiate between images of people with and without masks in real time and recorded.The model works effectively with no slack time between wearing/removing face mask and showing the prediction in percentage  The model is fit for predicting multiple faces with or without masks at the same time.
